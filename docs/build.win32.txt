-- I -- OVERVIEW --

Download the appropriate installation files from the OVAL Web site.

  A. Source Distributions

       The source for the Interpreter is freely available on the OVAL
       Web site.  There is currently a .zip file for windows users that
       contains all the source code as well as a VC7.1 project 
       interpreter.  To download the source go to:

            http://oval.mitre.org/language/download/interpreter/index.html

  B. Source Distribution Contents

       The source code distribution contains the source for
       the OVAL Interpreter and a Visual C++ 7.1 project. The source 
       distribution does not include the source for the libraries
       needed to compile the Interpreter. 

  C. Supporting Libraries

       The Interpreter relies on three c/c++ libraries that can be found
       on the web. See sections III - V for more information about the
       specific libraries used and where to download their source from.


-- II -- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS --

The following instructions describe how to build the OVAL Interpreter 
on a Windows system.  The OVAL Interpreter has been built on windows 
and tested on Windows 2000 and Windows XP Pro using VC8. The source 
distribution includes a project file that has can be used to build the
Interpreter.  Before the Interpreter can be built the supporting libraries
must be installed. Follow the instruction below to setup and install the
supporting libraries.

  A. PCRE (Perl-compatible regular-expression) Library
 
       The simplest way to setup the PCRE library on a Windows system is to
       download the "Complete package, except sources" (note: download 'Setup'
       not 'Zip') from:
       
          http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pcre.htm

       The download should be an executable that will install the binaries,
       developer files, and documentation on your machine.  Run this setup
       program and follow the instructions provided. 

       After the installation is complete you must add the PCRE lib and
       include directories to Visual C++. Add the following directory to 
       the include files search path:
       
          <installed path>\include
       
       Then add the following directory to the library files search path:

          <installed path>\lib

       In Visual C++ 7 the UI for setting up directories can be found by clicking the
       "Tools" menu then selecting "Options..." next selecting the "Project" folder
       and then choosing the "VC++ Directories" item.     


  B. Xerces Library

       Download install a binary distribution of version 2.7.0 of the xerces-c 
       library. The download file can be found at:

          http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/binaries/

       Unzip the binaries and add the location of the xerces-c.dll onto your 
       path environment variable.

       Add the following directory to the include files search path:
       
          <installed path>\include

       Add the following directory to the library files search path:

          <installed path>\lib

       In Visual C++ 7 the UI for setting up directories can be found by clicking the
       "Tools" menu then selecting "Options..." next selecting the "Project" folder
       and then choosing the "VC++ Directories" item. 

  C. Xalan Library
       Download install a binary distribution of version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c 
       library. The download file can be found at:

          http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xalan-c/binaries/

       Unzip the binaries and add the locations of the Xalan-C_1_10.dll and 
       XalanMessages_1_10.dll to your path environment variable.

       Add the following directory to the include files search path:
       
          <installed path>\include

       Add the following directory to the library files search path:

          <installed path>\lib

       In Visual C++ 7 the UI for setting up directories can be found by clicking the
       "Tools" menu then selecting "Options..." next selecting the "Project" folder
       and then choosing the "VC++ Directories" item. 

  D. OpenSSL Library

       You can get source from http://openssl.org/source/ and build it yourself,
       or you can get a binary installer from
       http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.  The instructions
       below assume you used the binary installer.

       Add the following directory to the include files search path:
       
          <installed path>\include

       Add the following directory to the library files search path:

          <installed path>\lib\VC

       Add the appropriate library, e.g. "libeay32MT.lib" to the list of
       dependency libraries.

       In Visual C++ 7 the UI for setting up directories can be found by clicking the
       "Tools" menu then selecting "Options..." next selecting the "Project" folder
       and then choosing the "VC++ Directories" item. 

  E. Building the OVAL Interpreter

      After setting up the PCRE, Xerces, and Xalan libraries open the provided project
      for the OVAL Interpreter. The project is in:

         Visual C++ 8:
         <installed path>\Interpreters\project\Win32\VC8\OVALInterpreter.vcproj

      From the build menu simply select "build" to build the OVAL Interpreter.
      Note that a "Debug" and a "Release" build configuration is provided.
 
-- III -- PCRE --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source PCRE library.  The Interpreter
currently uses version 6.3 of the PCRE library.  From the PCRE Web site:

  "Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library 
   package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel,
   and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England."

For more information about PCRE visit:

    http://www.pcre.org

To download the source code for PCRE, please use the following ftp
site:

    ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/


-- IV -- XERCES --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The
binary was compiled with version 2.7 of the xerces-c library.  From
the Xerces Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

For more information about Xerces visit:

    http://xml.apache.org

The source code is also available at the above Web site.

-- V -- XALAN --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The
binary was compiled with version 1.10 of the xalan-c library.  From
the Xalan Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

For more information about Xalan visit:

    http://xml.apache.org

-- VI -- OPENSSL --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open-source OpenSSL library.

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
