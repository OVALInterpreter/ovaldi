-- I -- OVERVIEW --

Download the appropriate installation files from the OVAL Interpreter SourceForge site.

  A. Source Distributions

       The source for the OVAL Interpreter is freely available on the OVAL
       Interpreter SourceForge site.  There is currently a .zip file for
	   Windows users that contains all of the source code as well as a Visual
	   C++ project for the OVAL Interpreter.  To download the source go to:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovaldi/files/
		
	   The latest source for the OVAL Interpreter is also freely available on
	   the OVAL Interpreter SourceForge site and can be accessed via SVN.
	   Please see the following link for more information:
	   
	       http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=215469
		
  B. Source Distribution Contents

       The source code distribution contains the source for
       the OVAL Interpreter and a Visual C++ project. The source 
       distribution does not include the source for the libraries
       needed to compile the OVAL Interpreter. 

  C. Supporting Libraries

       The OVAL Interpreter relies on four C/C++ libraries that can be found
       on the Web. See sections III - VI for more information about the
       specific libraries used and where to download their source from.


-- II -- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS --

The following instructions describe how to build the OVAL Interpreter 
on a Windows system.  The OVAL Interpreter has been built on Windows 
and tested on Windows XP Pro using VC8 and the Windows 7 SDK. The source
distribution includes a project file that can be used to build the OVAL
Interpreter. Before the OVAL Interpreter can be built, the supporting
libraries must be installed. Follow the instruction below to setup and
install the supporting libraries.

  A. PCRE (Perl-compatible regular-expression) Library
 
       The simplest way to setup the PCRE library on a Windows system is to
       download the "Complete package, except sources" (note: download 'Setup'
       not 'Zip') from:
       
          http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pcre.htm

       The download should be an executable that will install the binaries,
       developer files, and documentation on your machine.  Run this setup
       program and follow the instructions provided. 

       After the installation is complete, you must add the PCRE lib and
       include directories to Visual C++. Add the following directory to 
       the include files search path:
       
          <installed path>\include
       
       Then add the following directory to the library files search path:

          <installed path>\lib

       In Visual C++ 7 the UI for setting up directories can be found by clicking the
       "Tools" menu then selecting "Options...", next selecting the "Project" folder,
       and then choosing the "VC++ Directories" item.     


  B. Xerces Library

       Download and install a binary distribution of the xerces-c library.
	   The OVAL Interpreter currently uses version 2.7.0 of the xerces-c
	   library. The binary distribution file can be found at:

          http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/binaries/

       Please refer to 'build.xerces.xalan.win32.txt' for instructions on how to build the
	   xerces-c library on Windows. 

  C. Xalan Library
      
	   Download and install a binary distribution of the xalan-c library. The OVAL Interpreter
	   currently uses version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library. The binary distribution file can
	   be found at:

          http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xalan-c/binaries/

       Please refer to 'build.xerces.xalan.win32.txt' for instructions on how to build the
	   xalan-c library on Windows.

  D. OpenSSL Library

       You can get source from http://openssl.org/source/ and build it yourself,
       or you can get a binary installer from
       http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.  The instructions
       below assume you used the binary installer.

       Add the following directory to the include files search path:
       
          <installed path>\include

       Add the following directory to the library files search path:

          <installed path>\lib\VC

       Add the appropriate library, e.g. "libeay32MT.lib" to the list of
       dependency libraries.

       In Visual C++ 7 the UI for setting up directories can be found by clicking the
       "Tools" menu then selecting "Options..." next selecting the "Project" folder
       and then choosing the "VC++ Directories" item.

       (eay@cryptsoft.com)" 
	   
  E. Building the OVAL Interpreter

      After setting up the PCRE, Xerces, and Xalan libraries open the provided project
      for the OVAL Interpreter. The project is in:

         Visual C++ 8:
         <path to ovaldi directory>\project\Win32\VC8\OVALInterpreter.vcproj

      From the build menu simply select "build" to build the OVAL Interpreter.
      Note that a "Debug" and a "Release" build configuration is provided.
 
-- III -- PCRE --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source PCRE library.  The OVAL Interpreter
currently uses version 8.x of the PCRE library.  From the PCRE Web site:

  "Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library 
   package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel,
   and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England."

The PCRE library is under the BSD License and is re-distributed in
ovaldi-x.x.x-setup.exe. As a result, a copy of the license
(LICENCE.pcre) has been provided.    
   
For more information about PCRE visit:

    http://www.pcre.org

To download the source code for PCRE, please use the following FTP
site:

    ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/


-- IV -- XERCES --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The
binary was compiled with version 2.7 of the xerces-c library.  From
the Xerces Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

The Xerces library is under the Apache 2.0 License and is re-distributed
in ovaldi-x.x.x-setup.exe and ovaldi-libs-x.x.x-1.i386.rpm. As a result, 
a copy of the license (LICENCE.xerces_xalan) has been provided.    
  
For more information about Xerces visit:

    http://xml.apache.org

The source code is also available at the above Web site.

-- V -- XALAN --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The
binary was compiled with version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library.  From
the Xalan Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

The Xalan library is under the Apache 2.0 License and is re-distributed
in ovaldi-x.x.x-setup.exe and ovaldi-libs-x.x.x-1.i386.rpm. As a result,
a copy of the license (LICENCE.xerces_xalan) has been provided.  
  
For more information about Xalan visit:

    http://xml.apache.org

-- VI -- OPENSSL --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open-source OpenSSL library.

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually, both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL,
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

  A copy of the license (LICENSE.openssl) has been provided.

For more information about OpenSSL visit:
