---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.3 build ??     ---
---------------------------------------
* Corrected bug in REGEX.cpp. Expanded the vector of integers for substrings to allow for more matching. Thanks to Tony Worwood (tony.worwood@lumension.com) for tracking down the bug and fixing it. 
* Corrected bug in AbsObjectCollector::ProcessSet and AbsObjectCollector::Intersection wich caused set intersections to be improperly evaluated. Thanks to Tony Worwood (tony.worwood@lumension.com) for tracking down the bug and fixing it. 
* Improved source documentation.
* Implemented resolve_group and include_group behaviors for win-def:fileeffectiverights_object.
* Implemented escape_regex function defined in the oval-definitions-schema.
* Corrected bug in REGEX::EscapeRegexChars() function. When the first char in the input string needed to be escaped the function failed.
* Corrected bug in SubstringFunction::ComputeValue() function that caused the flag to be set incorrectly.
* Corrected bug in ProcessProbe. File handles were not properly being closed when reading the /proc dir. Thanks to Sudhakar Govindavajhala (sudhakarg79@gmail.com) for the tracking down and fixing this issue.
* Added vendor name to generator elements. Makes use of the xsd:any tag in the generator element definition.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.3 build 59     ---
---------------------------------------
* Corrected bug in FileEffectiveRightsProbe. The probe was improperly reading the access rights for a file.
* Improved debug logging in the AuditEventPolicyProbe.
* Added #include <cstring> to REGEX.h and Common.h to file compiler errors when building with GCC 4.3. Thanks to Lubomir Kundrak (lkundrak@redhat.com) for the fix.
* Corrected bug in EntityComparator::CompareEvrString. Thanks to Mark Cox (mjc@redhat.com) for the fix.
* Source code comments were cleaned up.
* Updated Windows FileProbe to use GetFileTime API for a, m, and c times. Code was previously using stat. The schema documentation said to use GetFileTime.
* Corrected bug in Windows RegistryProbe that was incorrectly appending a trailing space to binary registry values.
* Corrected bug in windows/FileEffectiveRightsProbe::GetEffectiveRights. Access right were being read incorrectly. 
* Corrected bug in caching of Items during evaluation. The cache of items was effectively not being used because the call to cache a new item was made before the item was parsed from the xml. The cache is based on an item's id. The id is not set until the item is parsed.
* Improved caching code used in Definition, Test, and State evaluate.
* Corrected bug in RegistryProbe::RetrieveInfo method. When processing a REG_MULTI_SZ value the last value was not being collected. Thanks to Ken Lassesen (ken.lassesen@lumension.com) for reporting the issue.
* Corrected bug in EntityComparator::CompareInteger. not equals operation was not properly being evaluated.
* Corrected bug in RegistryProbe::RetrieveInfo method. When processing a REG_SZ value for a registry value set to an empty string a '?' was occasionally being recorded as the value. Thanks to Thayne Harmon (thayne.harmon@lumension.com) for the fix.
* Corrected bug in XmlFileContentProbe::EvaluateXpath method. The code to transcode a text node's value to a string was not always succeeding.
* Added support for xpath selection of attribute nodes to existing XmlFileContentProbe::EvaluateXpath method.
* Corrected bug that was creating a tests and definitions element in the result document even if they were not needed. This only occurs if an input oval-definitions document has no definitions or no tests.
* Corrected bug in EntityComparator::CompareFloat. not equals operation was not properly being evaluated.
* Corrected bug in EntityComparator::CompareBoolean. not equals and equals operations were not properly being evaluated. Thanks to Ken Lassesen (ken.lassesen@lumension.com) for reporting the issue.
* Corrected bug in PasswordPolicyProbe. Code was converting max an min password age to days. Should have been in seconds. Thanks to Ken Lassesen (ken.lassesen@lumension.com) for reporting the issue.
* Improved error messages in AuditEventPolicyProbe::CollectItems().
* Improved error messages in FileProbe.
* Corrected bug in Item::Equals function that returned false when items do not have any object entities. If there are no object entities the two item should be considered equal.
* Modified AuditEventPolicyProbe::ReadAuditOptions() to treat POLICY_AUDIT_EVENT_UNCHANGED as AUDIT_NONE.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.3 build 40     ---
---------------------------------------
* Implemented TextFileContentProbe and documented weaknesses in the oval-definitions-schema. The code for this probe is based on contributions from Pavel Vinogradov (Pavel.Vinogradov@NIXDEV.NET)
* Added REGEX::GetMatchingSubstrings function to allow matched substrings to be pulled from an input string.
* Corrected Test::EvaluateCheckExistence method's combining of items based on the check_extistence attribute. The schema documentation was changed causing a code change to the interpreter source.  
* Corrected bug in processing of AccessToken behaviors. 
* Corrected bug in EntityCompartator that was causing the parse version string method to fail on 64 bit Linux systems. Thanks to Ken Sorensen (sorensk@losrios.edu) and Mark Cox (mjc@redhat.com) for tracking this down and fixing it. Applied similar fixes to problematic areas of the code.
* Corrected bug in processing of variable components. Needed to make a copy of the messages associated with a ComponentValue when computing a value for a Component.
* Corrected bug in AbsObjectCollector::ProcessObject function. The code was not correctly computing the flag value on collected objects. The flag value should be based on the combination of the status value of each referenced item.
* Updated Linux makefile to support rpm and dpkg package managers on Linux systems.
* Corrected bug in processing of unix file_object behaviors. This required an update to AbsFileFinder and both the Linux and Windows FileFinder implementations. The bug allowed unsupported unix file_object behaviors to go reported on unix systems. 2 of 4 unix file_object behaviors are supported at this time. Now if an unsupported unix file_object behavior is found an error message is reported.
* Corrected bug in processing of command line arguments which caused the -p flag to not be considered until after some code had already been executed.
* Source code comments were cleaned up.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.3 build 20     ---
---------------------------------------

* Added command line option to limit definition evaluation to a set of definition ids provided on the command line. 
* Added function to list error messages associated with a variable. This gives better error reporting on variables.
* Added support for previous minor versions of the OVAL Language. The code now allows for any version greater than or equal to version 5.0 and less than or equal to the version of the Oval Interpreter itself.
* Added support for new account privileges defined in Vista to the AccessTokenProbe.
* Corrected bug in code that determines the namespace of an element. Reported by Thomas Jones.
* Added support for behaviors on the win:accesstoken_object.
* Added support for the ONE operator on criteria.
* Added support for the new check_existence attribute and modified check attribute on tests.
* Added doxygen generated source documentation to source distributions.
* Added support for optional Schematron validation of oval-defintitions documents.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.2 build 9      ---
---------------------------------------
* Corrected bug in windows implementation of SystemInfoCollector::GetOSInfo. On some systems the interpreter would not collected system data because of an error thrown when getting the primary host name of the system.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.2 build 8      ---
---------------------------------------
* Updated to support OVAL version 5.2
* Converted windows source distributions to include a VC8 project
* Windows binaries are now built with Visual Studio 2005(VC8).
* Added support for recurse_direction and max_depth behaviors on files. 
* Added support for collection of additional fields in win-sc:file_items.
* Removed unneeded oval-def xmlns from generated system-characteristics files.
* Added support for filehash_tests.
* Corrected bug in results_to_html.xsl that was not creating valid urls to definitions in the results section of the output.
* Corrected bug in RegistryProbe. Added an additional result value to the list of values that equate to a registry key does not exist on the system. Previously was reporting an error when the key was not found. Fix applied to registry names too.
* Corrected bug in RegistryProbe. When collected data for a REG_MULTI_SZ if the value was an empty string it was not reported properly which lead to incorrect unknown results.
* Corrected bug in AbsEntity::Analyze method. This bug caused the interpreter to not be able to properly use variable values in some complex objects. The interpreter then would incorrectly report items as not found on a host.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.1 build 14     ---
---------------------------------------
* Added newlines to end of RestrictionType.cpp and ExternalVariable.cpp to prevent compile warnings

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.0 build 74     ---
---------------------------------------
* Corrected bug display of object and definition ids as they are being processed. Bug caused objects that were actually not applicable to be flagged as not collected.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.0 build 71     ---
---------------------------------------
* Added support for data collection of win-def:passwordpolicy_object. Need to figure out how to get password_complexity and reversible_encryption fields. 
* Added support for data collection of win-def:lockoutpolicy_object. 
* Added support for data collection of win-def:auditeventpolicy_object.

* Added support for data collection of win-def:accesstoken_test.
* Added support for data collection of win-def:group_test.
* Added support for data collection of win-def:user_test.
* Corrected bug in Object::Parse method. There was a typo in the name of the behaviors element that would cause behaviors to be ignored.
* Corrected bug in AbsObjectCollector::ProcessSet method. CollectedSets were no always being initialized causing a NULL ptr error.
* Corrected bug in error reporting on windows FileProbe. Error messages were being appended one after the other resulting in many repeated messages.
* Corrected bug in Item::Write() method. Only one message element is allowed on a given item.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.0 build 67     ---
---------------------------------------
* Added support for external variables. 
* Cleaned up command line processing. Added better messages when invalid command line options are provided.
* Corrected typo in parse function that would have caused the datatype on constant variables to be ignored when parsing and always treated as the a string
* Corrected bug in reporting of result on a tested_item element. In some cases the result was left as it default error value. This did not effect the overall result computation for a test.
* Corrected bug in Variable probe causing it to always fail to collect variable information.
* Added support to the WMIProbe for addition datatypes. Previously only supported strings.
* Corrected bug in AbsObjectCollector that lead to error details not being reported in the system-characteristics file.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.0 build 55     ---
---------------------------------------
* Corrected a bug in analysis of extended definitions. Definition result values were not properly cached after initial analysis. Caused incorrect result when a extended definition is used more than once.
* Corrected a bug in analysis of tests. Tests result values were not properly cached after initial analysis. May have caused in accurate results when a test is reused.
* Corrected a bug in xmlfilecontent probe and file md5 probe. Both probes were using a windows path separator character regardless of the platform they were run on. This prevented proper data collection on UNIX platforms.
* Corrected a bug related to locating elements in an oval definition document when all elements are prefixed by an xmlns alias. The search method used was not properly matching prefixed elements. 
* Corrected bug in Test::Analyze function - When a CollectedObject has a flag value of NOT_COLLECTED_FLAG the result value should be UNKNOWN_RESULT not NOT_EVALUATED_RESULT.
* Corrected bug in OvalEnum::CombineResultsByCheck method when check was ONLY_ONE_CHECK results were not always correct.
* Corrected bug in Test::Analyze method. When a CollectedObject has a flag of NOT_COLLECTED_FLAG the result should be UNKNOWN_RESULT. When a check of NONE_EXIST_CHECK is specified the results were not always correct.
* Corrected bug in xpath code. removed extra ItemEntity created when creating a xmlfilecontent_item.
* Corrected bug in Definition::Analyze method. Added line to set the flag indicating that the definition has been analyzed.
* Corrected bug in processing of flag attribute on collected objects when the definition object is a set object. Added new CollectedSet class to support changes.
