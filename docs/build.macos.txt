-- I -- OVERVIEW --

Download the appropriate installation files from the OVAL Interpreter SourceForge site.

  A. Source Distributions

       The source for the OVAL Interpreter is freely available on the OVAL Interpreter
       SourceForge site.  There is currently a bzipped tarball for Mac OS users 
       that contains all of the source code as well as a Makefile for 
       the OVAL Interpreter.  To download the source go to:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovaldi/files/

       The latest source for the OVAL Interpreter is also freely available on
       the OVAL Interpreter SourceForge site and can be accessed via SVN.
       Please see the following link for more information:
	   
	    http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=215469		
			
  B. Source Distribution Contents

       The source code distribution contains the source for
       the OVAL Interpreter. The source distribution does not include
       the source for the libraries needed to compile the OVAL Interpreter.

  C. Supporting Libraries

       The OVAL Interpreter relies on five C/C++ libraries that can be found
       on the web. See sections III - VII for more information about the
       specific libraries used and where to download their source from.
     
-- II -- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS --

The following instructions describe how to build the OVAL Interpreter on a
Mac OS system.  The OVAL Interpreter has been built and tested on the 32-bit version of
Mac OSX Snow Leopard (10.6). The source distribution includes a Makefile that can be used
to build the OVAL Interpreter on Mac OS systems. Before the OVAL Interpreter can be built,
the supporting libraries must be installed.  Follow the instruction below to setup and
install the supporting libraries.

  A. PCRE (Perl-compatible regular-expression) Library
 
	The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE)
	library.  The OVAL Interpreter is compatible with version 8.x of the PCRE library.
	
	The source code for the PCRE library can be downloaded from the following link.
	
	        ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/
	
	To compile and install the PCRE library simply run the following commands.
 
            ./configure -prefix='install path'
			make
            sudo make install

  B. Xerces Library

       The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The following
       instructions are slightly different between OSX 10.6 and 10.7 due to
       compatibility problems with xerces 2.8 on OSX 10.7.

       OSX 10.7:

       The macports version of xerces 2.8.0 was causing ovaldi to crash, so we
       built our own binaries from source.  To make the build work, we applied
       the "macsvn.diff" patch, which is available from

       https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESC-1772
       or
       https://trac.macports.org/ticket/22287

       OSX 10.6:

       We built xerces 2.7 from source.  No patching was required.

       In either case, the source code for the Xerces-C library can be
       downloaded from the following link.

           http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/ (for 2.7)
           or
           http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi (for 2.8)

       To compile and install the Xerces-C library (this example builds 32-bit
       xerces 2.7), simply run the following commands.

           export XERCESCROOT='<path to xerces-c>/xerces-c-src_2_7_0'
           cd $XERCESCROOT/src/xercesc
           ./runConfigure -p macosx -n native -b 32 -c gcc -x g++ -P 'install path'
           make
           sudo -E make install

       Building xerces 2.8 on OSX 10.7 after having applied the patch, is 
       analogous.

  C. Xalan Library

       The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The
       binary was compiled with version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library.
	   
       The source code for the Xalan-C library can be downloaded from the following link.
	   
           http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xml/xalan-c
	   
       To compile and install the Xalan-C library simply run the following commands.
	   
           export XALANCROOT='<path to xalan-c>/xml-xalan/c'
	       export XERCESCROOT='<install path of xerces-c>'
           cd $XALANCROOT
           ./runConfigure -p macosx -c gcc -x g++ -P 'install path'
           make
           sudo -E make install

  F. Libgcrypt Library

       The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Libgcrypt library.  The
       binary was compiled with version 1.4.6 of the Libgcrypt library.
	   
       The source code for the Libgcrypt library can be downloaded from the following link.
	   
           http://www.gnupg.org/download/#libgcrypt
	   
       To compile and install the Libgcrypt library simply run the following commands.
  
           ./configure --prefix='install path'
           make
           sudo make install

  G. OpenLDAP Library
  
      The OVAL Interpreter utilizes the open source OpenLDAP library to
      execute the LDAP probe.  The binary was compiled with version 2.3.27 of the OpenLDAP
      library.

      The source code for the OpenLDAP library can be downloaded from the following link.
	   
          ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/openldap-release
	   
      To compile and install the OpenLDAP library simply run the following commands.
  
          ./configure --prefix='install path'
          make
          make depend
          sudo make install
  	
  H. Building the OVAL Interpreter

      After installing the PCRE, Xerces-C, and Xalan-C, Libgcrypt, and OpenLDAP libraries,
      change into the directory:

          <path to ovaldi directory>\project\macos

      From that directory, simply run "make" to build the OVAL Interpreter.  Note that it
      may be necessary to update the Makefile with the appropriate lib and include directories
      depending on the 'install path' used for the libraries.  The executable will be located
      in the <path to ovaldi directory>\project\macos\Release directory.
