The MITRE Corporation developed the OVAL Interpreter to 
demonstrate the usability of the OVAL Language. The source for
the OVAL Interpreter is freely available for reference use. This
document describes the steps you need to build the OVAL 
Interpreter on a Solaris system.

For information about using the OVAL Interpreter refer to the
README.txt file included with the OVAL Interpreter, or the OVAL Web
site.

-- I -- OVERVIEW --

Download the appropriate installation files from the OVAL Interpreter
SourceForge site.

  A. Source Distributions

       The source for the OVAL Interpreter is freely available on the OVAL
       Interpreter SourceForge site.  There is currently a bzipped
       tarball for Solaris users that contains all of the source code as
       well as a Makefile for the OVAL Interpreter.  To download the
       source go to:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovaldi/files/

       The latest source for the OVAL Interpreter is also freely
       available on the OVAL Interpreter SourceForge site and can be
       accessed via SVN. Please see the following link for more
       information:

            http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=215469		

  B. Source Distribution Contents

       The source code distribution contains the source for
       the OVAL Interpreter. The source distribution does not include
       the source for the libraries needed to compile the OVAL
       Interpreter.

  C. Supporting Libraries

       The OVAL Interpreter relies on four C/C++ libraries that can be
       found on the web. See sections III - VI for more information
       about the specific libraries used and where to download their
       source from.

-- II -- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS --

The following instructions describe how to build the OVAL Interpreter
on a Solaris system.  The OVAL Interpreter has been built and tested
on 32-bit versions of Solaris 10. The source distribution includes a 
Makefile that can be used to build the OVAL Interpreter on Solaris 
systems.  Before the OVAL Interpreter can be built, the supporting 
libraries must be installed.  Follow the instructions below to setup 
and install the supporting libraries.

  A. PCRE (Perl-compatible regular-expression) Library

       Solaris 10 doesn't come out of the box with the PCRE library.
       You will have to install the library yourself.  See
       http://www.pcre.org and section III of this file.

  B. Xerces Library

       The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The
       binary was compiled with version 2.7.0 of the xerces-c library.
       From the Xerces Web site:

         "This product includes software developed by the Apache
         Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

       For more information about Xerces visit:

         http://xml.apache.org

       The source code is also available at the above Web site.

  C. Xalan Library

       The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The
       binary was compiled with version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library.
       From the Xalan Web site:

         "This product includes software developed by the Apache
         Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

       For more information about Xerces visit:

         http://xml.apache.org

       The source code is also available at the above Web site.

  D. Libgcrypt Library

       You can get the source from http://www.gnupg.org/download/#libgcrypt and build it
	   yourself, or you can usually get a binary package using an installer specific
	   to your flavor of Linux (e.g. RPM for redhat, APT for debian).  The ovaldi
	   Makefile already includes the proper variables and commandline to link to
	   Libgcrypt, and should work if the libraries and headers are in standard places.
	   If not, you may need to make adjustments.

       For more information about Libgcrypt please visit:
         http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libraries.en.html#lib-libgcrypt

  E. Building the OVAL Interpreter

      After installing (or verifying you already have) the PCRE,
      Xerces, and Xalan, and Libgcrypt libraries, change into the
      directory:

        <path to ovaldi directory>\project\solaris

      From that directory, simply run "gmake" to build the OVAL
      Interpreter.  Note that development was done with GNU tools, and
      it is advisable to use them to build ovaldi.  The Solaris
      makefile is known to be incompatible with Solaris make.  GNU
      tools on Solaris 10 are in the /usr/sfw/bin directory and are
      often prefixed with "g".

-- III -- PCRE --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source PCRE library.  The OVAL
Interpreter currently uses version 8.x of the PCRE library.  From the
PCRE Web site:

  "Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library 
   package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel,
   and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England."

For more information about PCRE visit:

   http://www.pcre.org

To download the source code for PCRE, please use the following FTP
site:

   ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

-- IV -- XERCES --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The
binary was compiled with version 2.7.0 of the xerces-c library.  From
the Xerces Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

For more information about Xerces visit:

  http://xml.apache.org

The source code is also available at the above Web site.

-- V -- XALAN --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The binary
was compiled with version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library.  From the
Xalan Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

For more information about Xalan visit:

    http://xml.apache.org

The source code is also available at the above Web site.

-- VI -- LIBGCRYPT --

The OVAL Interpreter uses the open-source Libgcrypt library.  The binary
was compiled with version 1.1.12 of the Libgcrypt library.  From the
Libgcrypt Web site:

	"Libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the
	code from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptographic building
	blocks: symmetric ciphers, hash algorithms, MACs, public key
	algorithms, large integer functions, random numbers and a lot of
	supporting functions."
  
For more information about Libgcrypt visit:
    http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libraries.en.html#lib-libgcrypt

The source code is also available at the above Web site.

-- VII -- REPORTING PROBLEMS --

To report a problem with OVAL Interpreter, please add a bug tracker
item, or create a post on the OVAL Interpreter Help Project Forum,
with a brief description of the problem on the OVAL Interpreter
SourceForge site
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovaldi/support). Please include the
platform that the OVAL Interpreter was run on, the version of the OVAL
Interpreter, and the OVAL Definitions document that was used.
