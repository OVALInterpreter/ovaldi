-- I -- OVERVIEW --

Download the appropriate installation files from the OVAL Web site.

  A. Source Distributions

       The source for the Interpreter is freely available on the OVAL
       Web site.  There is currently a bzipped tarball for linux users 
       that contains all the source code as well as a Makefile for 
       the interpreter.  To download the source go to:

            http://oval.mitre.org/language/download/interpreter/index.html

  B. Source Distribution Contents

       The source code distribution contains the source for
       the OVAL Interpreter. The source distribution does not include
       the source for the libraries needed to compile the Interpreter.


  C. Supporting Libraries

       The Interpreter relies on three c/c++ libraries that can be found
       on the web. See sections III - V for more information about the
       specific libraries used and where to download their source from.
     
-- II -- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS --

The following instructions describe how to build the OVAL Interpreter on a
Linux system.  The OVAL Interpreter has been built and tested on Red Hat 
32 bit versions of Enterprise Linux 3 and 4. The source distribution includes
a Makefile that has can be used to build the Interpreter on Linux systems.
Before the Interpreter can be built the supporting libraries must be installed.
Follow the instruction below to setup and install the supporting libraries.

  A. PCRE (Perl-compatible regular-expression) Library
 
       Red Hat Enterprise 3 and Red Hat 9 generally include the PCRE 
       library.  If it has not been installed your system, it is easiest
       to simply install the pcre-devel RPM, available from Red Hat via
       your install media or Internet download method.

  B. Xerces Library

       The Definition Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The
       binary was compiled with version 2.7.0 of the xerces-c library.  From
       the Xerces Web site:

         "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
	 Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

       For more information about Xerces visit:

         http://xml.apache.org

       The source code is also available at the above Web site.

       Note: Our ovaldi RPM places a pre-compiled copy of this library into
             /usr/lib/ovaldi to reduce the dependencies that an unsophisticated
             user would need to resolve.

  C. Xalan Library

       The Definition Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The
       binary was compiled with version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library.  From
       the Xalan Web site:

         "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
	 Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

       For more information about Xerces visit:

         http://xml.apache.org

       The source code is also available at the above Web site.

       Note: Our ovaldi RPM places a pre-compiled copy of this library into
             /usr/lib/ovaldi to reduce the dependencies that an unsophisticated
             user would need to resolve.

  D. RPM

      The Definition Interpreter can be compiled to utilize libraries provided by 
      the RPM Package Manager (RPM) in order to complete certain RPM-specific tasks.
      Utilizing RPM libraries will allow the Definition Interpreter to execute RPM
      Probes.

      For more information about RPM please visit:
        http://www.rpm.org

  E. APT

      The Definition Interpreter can be compiled to utilize libraries provided by 
      the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) in order to complete certain APT-specific tasks.
      Utilizing APT libraries will allow the Definition Interpreter to execute DPKG
      Probes.
      
      For more information about APT please visit:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool

 
  F. Building the OVAL Interpreter

      After installing the PCRE, Xerces, and Xalan libraries, change into the 
      directory:

        <installed path>\Interpreter\project\linux

      From that directory, simply run "make" to build the XML Definition
      Interpreter.
 
-- III -- PCRE --

The Interpreter uses the open source PCRE library.  The Interpreter
currently uses version 6.3 of the PCRE library.  From the PCRE Web site:

  "Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library 
   package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel,
   and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England."

For more information about PCRE visit:

    http://www.pcre.org

To download the source code for PCRE, please use the following ftp
site:

    ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

-- IV -- XERCES --

The Definition Interpreter uses the open source Xerces library.  The
binary was compiled with version 2.7.0 of the xerces-c library.  From
the Xerces Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

For more information about Xerces visit:

    http://xml.apache.org

The source code is also available at the above Web site.


    Note: Our ovaldi RPM places a pre-compiled copy of this library into
          /usr/lib/ovaldi to reduce the dependencies that an unsophisticated
          user would need to resolve.


-- V -- XALAN --

The Definition Interpreter uses the open source Xalan library.  The
binary was compiled with version 1.10.0 of the xalan-c library.  From
the Xalan Web site:

  "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/)."

For more information about Xalan visit:
